# basicpython3d

A 3D graphics engine built from scratch in Python, only using the numpy, pygame, and pygame_gui packages. 
Supports importing .obj 3D models, basic transformations, and camera movement. 
Created as a secondary school project to explore graphics pipelines from scratch, and as a mathematical education tool.
Renders using perspective projection and the rasterisation pipeline.

Features:
  - Import 3D object models
  - Simple transformations: translation, rotation, scaling
  - Camera control: movement, rotation, FOV
  - View and edit parameters in real time using the GUI
  - View and edit matrices (camera, model, perspective) in real time using the GUI

## Usage
Run main.py in /src.
